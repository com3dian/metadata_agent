"""Execution topology definitions for the multi-agent system.

This module defines ``EXECUTION_TOPOLOGIES``: named execution presets that
control how plans are executed.

Each topology contains:
    ``description``:
        Human-readable summary of the execution strategy used by the topology.
    ``players_per_step``:
        How many players work on each step in parallel.
    ``debate_rounds``:
        How many critique/revise cycles occur within each step.
    ``player_pool``:
        Which player roles can be assigned to steps. ``PLAYER_CONFIGS`` are
        defined in ``src/players/configs.py``.

Available topologies:
    ``default``:
        Standard execution with 3 parallel players per step, 2 debate rounds,
        and comprehensive player pool.

        - ``players_per_step``: 3
        - ``debate_rounds``: 2
        - ``player_pool``: ``data_analyst``, ``schema_expert``,
          ``metadata_specialist``
    ``fast``:
        Quick execution with 2 parallel players and minimal debate.

        - ``players_per_step``: 2
        - ``debate_rounds``: 1
        - ``player_pool``: ``data_analyst``, ``schema_expert``
    ``thorough``:
        Thorough execution with more players and extended debate.

        - ``players_per_step``: 4
        - ``debate_rounds``: 3
        - ``player_pool``: ``data_analyst``, ``schema_expert``,
          ``metadata_specialist``, ``critic``
    ``single``:
        Single-player execution with no debate. Fastest but least robust.

        - ``players_per_step``: 1
        - ``debate_rounds``: 0
        - ``player_pool``: ``data_analyst``

.. note::
   The orchestrator automatically adds ``relationship_analyst`` to the player
   pool for multi-context dataset analysis. No need for separate multi-context
   topologies.
