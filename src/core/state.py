"""
Defines the state schemas for the multi-agent system.

This module contains TypedDict definitions for:

1. StepExecutionState: State for executing a single plan step with parallel players
2. PlanExecutionState: Top-level state for executing an entire plan

Uses the unified ExecutionContext abstraction for all data access.

    State for executing a single plan step with multiple parallel players.
    
    This state is used by the step-level debate graph where:

    2. Players debate (critique and revise) their results
    3. One of the players synthesizes the final result using their role expertise
