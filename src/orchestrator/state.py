"""
Defines the state schemas for the multi-agent system.

This module contains TypedDict definitions for:
1. StepExecutionState: State for executing a single plan step with parallel players
2. PlanExecutionState: Top-level state for executing an entire plan

Uses the unified DataSource abstraction for all data access.
